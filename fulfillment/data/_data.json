      "Orangutans' arms are well suited to their lifestyle because they spend much of their time (some 90 percent) in the trees of their tropical rain forest home.",

      "The animals are long-lived and have survived as long as 60 years in captivity."

      "An elephant's trunk is actually a long nose with many functions. It is used for smelling, breathing, trumpeting, drinking, and also for grabbing things - especially a potential meal.",
      "The Asian Elephant's trunk alone contains about 100,000 different muscles.",
      "Elephants use their tusks to dig for roots and water, strip bark from trees, and even fight each other. Unfortunately their ivory has gotten them into a lot of trouble. Because ivory is so valuable to some humans, many elephants have been killed for their tusks. This trade is illegal today, but it has not been completely eliminated.",
      "At birth, elephants already weigh some 200 pounds and stand about three feet tall.",
